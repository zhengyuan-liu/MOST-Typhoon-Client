Spatio-temporal Typhoon Trajectory Modeling based on MOST (Moving Objects Spatial Temporal ) Model

Modeled typhoon trajectory based on Moving Objects Spatial Temporal (MOST) model to reduce volume of the typhoon dataset and provide full-time domain inquiry and short-time prediction for typhoon location.

This is a demo program developed by C# to visualize the model.
